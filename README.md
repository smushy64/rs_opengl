# [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) in Rust

This is a repository for my progress through the popular OpenGL tutorial *[Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) by Joey de Vries* written in Rust instead of C/C++.

I'm not gonna document every detail but I'll screenshot my progress and release little demos after major/interesting chapters :)
